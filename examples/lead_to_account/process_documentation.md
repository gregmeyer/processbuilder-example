## Error Handling
- All errors are logged with timestamp and context
- Critical errors trigger notifications to system administrators
- Non-critical errors are queued for daily review
- Retry attempts are logged with failure reasons

## Security Considerations
- All data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- Access is restricted based on role-based permissions
- Audit trail maintained for all changes
- Regular security reviews conducted
