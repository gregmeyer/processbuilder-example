Note1,"For a basic sandwich gather: 2 slices bread (white or wheat), 1-2 slices cheese (cheddar recommended), 2-3 leaves of fresh lettuce, 2-3 slices of tomato, mayo and mustard. Optional: deli meat ham or turkey, salt and pepper to taste.",Gather Ingredients
Note2,"To save time check multiple nearby stores with online inventory tools before leaving. Focus on supermarkets rather than convenience stores for better quality and selection. Consider frozen bread as a backup option if fresh bread is unavailable.",Go to Store
Note3,"Fresh bread should be soft to touch without visible mold spots. Check the expiration date on the packaging. Store bread properly (sealed tight in cool dry place) to maintain freshness longer. If bread is slightly stale but not moldy, toasting can improve texture.",Check Bread Freshness
Note4,"The optimal layering order: bread slice → condiments → cheese → meat (if using) → lettuce → tomato → condiments → bread slice. This prevents soggy bread by creating barriers between moisture-heavy ingredients and the bread. Pat tomato slices dry with paper towel before adding.",Add Main Ingredients
Note5,"Professional presentation includes: diagonal cut which displays layers attractively, arrangement on a clean plate with garnish (pickle spear, chips, or small side salad), wiping any drips from plate edges, and ensuring all layers are visible from the side. Consider a sandwich pick to hold taller sandwiches together.",Serve Sandwich
