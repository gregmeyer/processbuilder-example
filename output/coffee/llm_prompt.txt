Process Description:

Steps:
1. Create some coffee: Get ready to grind some beans
   Decision: Do you have beans?
   Success: Put in grinder -> Grind Beans
   Failure: Go to store -> Go to Store

2. Grind Beans: Measure the required amount of coffee beans based on the desired coffee strength and serving size. Using a grinder, grind the beans to a consistency suitable for the brewing method. This step prepares the coffee for optimal flavor extraction during brewing.
   Decision: Is the grind size consistent and appropriate for the selected brewing method?
   Success: When the decision is 'yes', indicating the grind size is consistent and appropriate for the selected brewing method, the coffee beans are now optimally prepared for brewing, ensuring maximum flavor extraction. This consistency in grind size facilitates an even extraction process, which is crucial for achieving the desired coffee strength and flavor profile. The next immediate step is to proceed with the brewing process using the freshly ground coffee. -> End
   Failure: Failure Outcome: If the grind size is found to be inconsistent or inappropriate for the selected brewing method after inspection, this leads to uneven extraction, significantly impacting the final coffee flavor. The error handling step involves discarding the incorrectly ground beans to prevent suboptimal brewing results. To recover from this failure, adjust the grinder settings to match the required consistency for the brewing method in question, then re-measure and grind a new batch of coffee beans accordingly. The next step in the failure path is to re -> End

3. Go to Store: 
   Decision: 
   Success:  -> End
   Failure:  -> end
